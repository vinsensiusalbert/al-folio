_In all my work, I endeavour to make life better for everyone._

I work as a Lead Data Scientist at Grab, solving industry challenges in the field of supply chain and deliveries, driving Southeast Asia forward.

Prior, I received my PhD from the Department of Industrial Systems Engineering & Management (ISEM), National University of Singapore (NUS) as a recipient of the NUS Research Scholarship.
My research interest is in the Ô¨Åeld of supply chain, logistics, and optimisation, employing a combination of operations research and simulation methods.
I was also involved in teaching as a graduate tutor at both undergraduate and graduate levels for courses in operations research, supply chain engineering, and programming methodology.
